# Password Guesser 🔐

This Python project simulates two methods of password guessing:
- **Brute Force** (random guesses, avoiding duplicates)
- **Exhaustive Linear Search** (0000 → 9999)

The goal is to compare how many attempts each method takes to correctly guess randomly generated 4-digit numeric passwords.

## 📊 Features

- Real-time plotting with `matplotlib`
- Comparison between brute force and linear search
- Color-coded graphs with live-updating average lines
- Terminal logging of each guess

## 🧠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies (if needed):
```bash
pip install matplotlib
